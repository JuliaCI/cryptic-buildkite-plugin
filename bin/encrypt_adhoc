    Congratulations, you have successfully encrypted an ad-hoc secret variable.

    This value should ONLY be used for things like ssh keys that must be available before
    any code has even been cloned to the worker machine.  By default, you should use the
    tools 'encrypt_file' or 'encrypt_variable' to get a more compartmentalized security
    barrier around your secrets.

    You should add the following environment variable stanza to the pipelines you want to
    have access to this secret.

    env:
      CRYPTIC_ADHOC_SECRET_${SECRET_NAME}: "${ENCRYPTED_SECRET_VALUE}"
