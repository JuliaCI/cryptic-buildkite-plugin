    Congratulations, you now have an agent keypair stored at ${KEY_PREFIX}.{key,pub}!
    These keyfiles must be deployed onto your agents, and the public keyfile will be
    used to generate a repository key and encrypt secrets, so keep it handy.

    Refer to the top-level README.md for the next step in setting up your repository.
