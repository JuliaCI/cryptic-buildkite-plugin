# Repository example for `cryptic-buildkite-plugin`

This is a simple example repository that we'll use in tests and to illustrate what a complex example can look like.
**NOTE**: This example embeds the agent private RSA key within the repository; this is purely for demonstration purposes.
**DO NOT** do this in your repositories!
